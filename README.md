# The Dog Food Repository

This project is a web application that aims to catalog dog food products available in Germany. The products are categorized in 3 categories: *Dry food*, *Wet food*, and *BARF*.

The first two categories contain products available through different retail channels while the *BARF* category lists the shops offering raw food.

Non-logged in users are able to browse the categories and products. Logged users can add new, edit, or delete products and product information.
